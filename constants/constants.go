/*
Go supports constants of character, string, boolean, and numeric values.

const declares a constant value.

A const statement can appear anywhere a var statement can.

Constant expressions perform arithmetic with arbitrary precision.

A numeric constant has no type until itâ€™s given one, such as by an explicit conversion.

A number can be given a type by using it in a context that requires one, such as a variable assignment or function call. For example, here math.Sin expects a float64.
